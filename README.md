# Overview
I wanted to create a free asset that anyone could use in their Unity project. A while ago when I decided I wanted to remaster Black Ops 2 zombies by myself, I realized I would need a really robust gun system. There are a lot of attachments and modifiers that interact with the guns as well. So I did just that, I created a really easy to implement gun system, with UI, attachments, different fire modes, recoil, and a ton more.

# Development Environment
I used unity and visual studio to create this project. I also used a few sites for free 3d models and textures. It was done completely with Unity's built in packages and my own code.
